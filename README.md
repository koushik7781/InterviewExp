# InterviewExp

I recently had the opportunity to interview with DevRev.

The process was both challenging and rewarding, comprising two technical rounds.
In the first round, I introduced myself, followed by questions on OOP concepts, databases, and my choice of Java as a language. I was asked why Java stands out, and the session concluded with coding tasks on arrays and loops.
The second round focused on my projects and their real-time applications, followed by a 30-minute coding challenge on Strings. Although the outcome wasn’t what I expected, I’m grateful for the smooth and insightful experience. It was a great learning curve for me as my first interview!
